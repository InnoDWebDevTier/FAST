            <p>WASHINGTON — A top specialist in chemical weapons for the Islamic State who is in American custody in northern Iraq has given military interrogators detailed information that resulted in two allied airstrikes in the last week against the group’s illicit weapons sites, Defense Department officials said Wednesday.</p>
            <p>The prisoner, an Iraqi identified by officials as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, was captured a month ago by commandos with an elite American Special Operations force. He was described by three officials as a “significant operative” in the Islamic State’s chemical weapons program. Another official said he once worked for Saddam Hussein’s Military Industrialization Authority.</p>
            <p>The Islamic State’s use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria has been known, but Mr. Afari’s capture has provided the United States with the opportunity to learn detailed information about the group’s secretive program, including where chemical agents were being stored and produced.</p>

            <p>The four small moons of Pluto turned out to be brighter and smaller than expected and spin quickly. Their axes are also tipped sideways, a configuration that defies easy explanation.</p>
            <p>Pluto and its miniature planetary system are believed to have coalesced out of a cataclysmic collision earlier in the history of the solar system. Over time, the rotation of moons tend to become gravitationally locked so that the same side of the moon is always facing the planet. That occurred with Charon.</p>
            <p>But the four smaller moons — Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos — are tiny and farther away. A month before the flyby, two astronomers suggested, based on years of Hubble photographs, that Nix and Hydra, appeared to be rotating chaotically, jostled by the competing gravitational pulls of Pluto and Charon. They also said that Kerberos was markedly darker than the other three.</p>
            <p>The New Horizons photographs showed otherwise. None of the moons appear to be rotating chaotically, and their spin is faster than expected, not at all locked to their orbital periods, which range from 20 to 38 days. Hydra spins fastest, at once every 10 hours. Kerberos turns out not to be dark; the four small moons are all brighter and smaller than previously estimated, ranging in reflectivity between fresh concrete and fresh snow.</p>

            <p>You and a friend want to make a box that helps control an air-conditioning unit. You both have dials that
emit a voltage: 0 means you want to leave the temperature as it is. Negative voltages mean that you want to
reduce the temperature. (It’s hot so we will assume that you never want to increase the temperature — so,
we’re not talking about a Berkeley summer. . . )</p>
